# Ping
 
## Summary 
Ping, a networking application built as a project at Lighthouse Labs. 
Ping measures the distance between users at networking events using Bluetooth running in the background and persists this data-using Realm. Late, users can access a list of other users who attended the event, sorted with those closest to them at a given time at the top of the list. This list includes information profile information gather from LinkedInâ€™s API, and links to each users LinkedIn profile. Users, profile information is passed between devices using the mobile backend as a service (MBaaS) Parse. Events can be scheduled by the user, which will trigger local notification that launch the app, which starts scanning for bluetooth signals when the even begins. 



## ToDo 
### New Features To be added 
 1. Pre-populate the list of events with 3rd party API's such as meet-up
 2. Add geo-fencing to insure that the user is at the event before turning on the bluetooth 
 3. add a comment field to table view cells so users can make notes about people they have met (comments would be stored locally)
